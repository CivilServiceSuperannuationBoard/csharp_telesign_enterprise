# Telesign Full-service C# SDK

[Telesign](https://telesign.com) connects, protects, and defends the customer experience with intelligence from billions of digital interactions and mobile signals. Through developer-friendly APIs that deliver user verification, digital identity, and omnichannel communications, we help the world's largest brands secure onboarding, maintain account integrity, prevent fraud, and streamline omnichannel engagement.

## Requirements

* **.NET Framework v4.5.2+**.
* **dotnet CLI** *(optional)* - This tool isn't required to use this SDK, but it is required to use the installation instructions below.  

> **NOTE:**
>
> These instructions are for MacOS. They will need to be adapted if you are installing on Windows.

## Installation

Follow these steps to add this SDK as a dependency to your project.

1. *(Optional)* Create a new directory for your C# project. Skip this step if you already have created a project. If you plan to create multiple C# projects that use Telesign, we recommend that you group them within a `telesign_integrations` directory.

```
    cd ~/code/local
    mkdir telesign_integrations
    cd telesign_integrations
    mkdir {your project name}
    cd {your project name}
```

2. Create a new C# solution using the dotnet CLI in the top-level directory of your project.

   `dotnet new console -o {name of the solution}`

   For example:

    `dotnet new console -o SendSMS`

3. Install the Telesign Full-service C# SDK using the dotnet CLI. This will also install the Telesign Self-service C# SDK since it is a dependency for the Full-service SDK. Once the SDK is installed, you should see a message in the terminal notifying you that you have successfully installed the SDK.

   `dotnet add package TelesignEnterprise --version 2.2.3`

4.	Reference the SDKs in the .cs file for your project using these statements:

```
    using Telesign;
    using TelesignEnterprise;
```

> **NOTE:**
> 
> There are alternate ways of installing this SDK. For examples, see this [SDK's page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TelesignEnterprise) in the NuGet gallery.

## Authentication

If you use a Telesign SDK to make your request, authentication is handled behind-the-scenes for you. All you need to provide is your Customer ID and API Key. The SDKs apply Digest authentication whenever they make a request to a Telesign service where it is supported. When Digest authentication is not supported, the SDKs apply Basic authentication.
